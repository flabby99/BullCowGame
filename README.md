# BullCowGame
My version of the BullCowGame from a Udemy course about Unreal!

Use the Isograms.cpp file on text input with a word per line in lowercase to produce a text ouput with all the isograms in that file.
My version of the BullCowGame is pretty similar to the course, but pulls isograms from the scrabble dictionary, lets users choose a word length and lets users sacrifice a turn for a hint.
